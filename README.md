# Stubs
A SwiftUI app for storing digital representations of concert ticket stubs. This is a demonstration app that incorporates iOS 17 features announced at WWDC23.

<b>Stubs</b> benefits from:
* SwiftData for persistence
* MapKit updates for SwiftUI
* Animated SF Symbols
* New ScrollView APIs
* Data from [TheAudioDB](https://www.theaudiodb.com) via [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/hub)
