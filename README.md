# Stubs
A SwiftUI app for storing digital representations of concert ticket stubs. The ticket stub data is used to search for venues on a map, and query related artist details, like images, biography, and discography. 

<b>Stubs</b> benefits from:
* SwiftData for persistence
* MapKit updates for SwiftUI
* Animated SF Symbols
* New ScrollView APIs
* Data from [TheAudioDB](https://www.theaudiodb.com) via [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/hub)

<b>Notice:</b> An API key from RapidAPI is required to run the app with a complete experience.
